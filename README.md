## <span id=Description> Description </span>

A website using the OpenWeather API to supply weather information and forecast for a given city

_The requirements of the assigment asked for a conditional colour around the UV index, unfortunatly it seems the UV information is now only available for paid customers of the API, as such i have performed a similar function on the humidity_
